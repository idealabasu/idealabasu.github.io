I am utilizing force sensing to calculate the center of balance of a quadrupedal laminate robot with the end goal of implementing a controls system capable of adapting in real time to changing ground angles. Each of the robot’s four legs have two degrees of freedom and are controlled by a four-bar system powered by two servo motors. While standing in place, the robot will behave like a parallel manipulator; when standing on an angled table, it will use the difference between the current force distribution and an ideal force distribution for balance to direct a change in leg length to counteract the angled ground. The laminate materials used to construct the robot make it a more cost effective research platform for researching controls problems.</p><p><em>This project was funded as part of a Barrett Honors thesis.</em></p><p>Students: Dante Roush</p><p><span class=badge>quadruped</span></p><a href=/projects/archive/dante-roush/><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Learn More...</button></a></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-heading><h3 class=panel-title>Bio-inspired bipedal robot design</h3></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row equal"><div class=col-sm-12><p><p>My research draws inspiration from terrestrial avians in terms of development of an optimized leg design for bipedal walking, running and jumping.

To gauge the dynamics of the leg for different functions I will be using Unity Simulation Engine and Visual Studio to validate the results of experimental testing and biomechanics research.

The aim of my project is to demonstrate that laminate robots can be utilized for higher level design by designing a laminate biped with model-based controls that can balance while standing and walking. This project starts from the early
prototyping design stage. Designs are created using python and Solidworks; PopupCAD is used to produce the DXF files needed for high speed laminate manufacturing. Through testing various design iterations, a design was reached with the ability to stand. The motors of this design were then modified to meet desired torque parameters. Testing has shown high torque is necessary to utilize robust control techniques, which will be used to balance the biped while it both stands and walks. Through python-based physics simulations utilizing Kane’s method, a model of the bipedal design can be created and linearized for controls applications. Since the system is fully controllable, LQR control techniques will be applied for balancing while standing and walking. Eventually, different control systems can be design and implemented for various system applications.</p><p><em>This project is part of an ongoing Masters' thesis.</em></p><p>Students: Taha Shafa</p><p><span class=badge>biped</span></p><a href=/projects/archive/taha-shafa/><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Learn More...</button></a></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-heading><h3 class=panel-title>Design of a Cutting Tool for Clearing Underwater Vegetation</h3></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row equal"><div class=col-sm-3><a href=/projects/archive/sheena-benson/><img class=img-responsive src=/assets/images/research/cutter.png alt></a></div><div class=col-sm-9><p>The objective of this research is to further the development of the bio-inspired fish being and constructed by Dr. Aukes and his team of student researchers by designing an inexpensive, reliable, and effective cutting tool to be used in conjunction with the robotic fish to cut and reduce the number of underwater vegetation growing in canals and waterways here in Phoenix.

This platform will allow a user to research complex motion and gait analysis control questions, and use different concepts in computer science and control theory methods to permit it to walk. The motion trajectory of each leg has been modeled in Python. Critical design considerations are the complexity of the laminate design, the rigidity of the materials of which the laminate is constructed, the accuracy of the transmission to control each leg, and the design of the force sensing legs.</p><p><em>This project was the result of coursework and a Masters thesis.</em></p><p>Students: Ben Shuch</p><p><span class=badge>archived</span></p><a href=/projects/archive/ben-shuch/><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Learn More...</button></a></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-heading><h3 class=panel-title>Development and Validation of a Custom Soft-Body FEA Simulator for Rapid Prototyping</h3></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row equal"><div class=col-sm-12><p><h2 id=descriprion>Descriprion</h2><p><em>How reliable are the forces generated by a simulation of a soft hydrogel robot when compared to a real-life counterpart</em></p><p>Hydrogels are water-swollen three-dimensional polymeric networks that respond to specific stimuli, such as electrical signals, magnetic fields, mechanical stress, light, or temperature1. These stimuli cause a controllable change in the shape or volume of the hydrogel, physically altering the molecular interactions
in the material. Voxels represent a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. Similarly to a pixel with an added dimension, and just like pixels, voxels can be used to make shapes and structures. Voxels allow the user to create discrete packages of material that perform predictably
and are easy to use. Hydrogel can technically be cast into many shapes and sizes, but using uniform cubes simplifies changes in the design, especially when many
iterations are expected.</p></p><p><em>Funding for this project was provided by FURI.</em></p><p><span class=badge></span></p><a href=/projects/archive/erick-duarte/><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Learn More...</button></a></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-heading><h3 class=panel-title>Development of an Multi-Process Planning Tool</h3></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row equal"><div class=col-sm-3><a href=/projects/archive/cole-brauer-manufacturing-planning/><img class=img-responsive src=/assets/images/research/voxel1.png alt></a></div><div class=col-sm-9><p><p>This project seeks to provide methods and set of tools for processing, modifying, and generating 3D models that use multiple materials and fabrication processes. Areas of research include planning of fabrication steps, automatic part modification, optimization of component properties, and generation of the
files and fixtures needed to produce multi-material parts. Implementation of these algorithms is done in Python using a voxel-based model representation. This work will make multi-material fabrication more accessible for educational and research robotics. Current work is focused on applications of graded materials in the design of robust material transitions. The results will inform the design of stronger flexible joints for use in low-cost robotics applications.

In this project we employ a curved structure to allow a rigid link to collapse preferentially in one direction when it encounters aerodynamic drag forces. A model was constructed in Python using the data gathered through the experiments and was tuned so that its outputs were as close as possible to the experimental results. As expected, increasing the wing diameter increased the total fall time, and increasing the payload mass decreased the total fall time. Orientation of the wings around the vertical axis of the glider relative to the direction of horizontal motion was also found to have an effect on the length of time between when the gliding platform was launched and when it made contact with the ground, with a configuration where the axis between the wings was parallel to the direction of motion granting added stability.</p><p><em>This project was funded as part of a Barrett Honors thesis.</em></p><p>Students: Guston Lighthouse</p><p><span class=badge>archived</span></p><a href=/projects/archive/guston-lighthouse/><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Learn More...</button></a></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-heading><h3 class=panel-title>Foldable Robotic Elephant Trunk</h3></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row equal"><div class=col-sm-12><p>Standard robotic arms are limited by their cost, size, and lack of flexibility. These factors make standard robotic arms difficult to apply in complex scenarios. While traditional, rigid robotic arms are used in factories and plants, they require meticulous planning, spacious locations, heavy funding, and can only be used for limited purposes, as they are inherently unsafe around humans. Laminate devices, on the other hand, are far more compact, flexible, cheap, and modular, as they use flat, somewhat flexible materials which fold up like a popup-book to create complex nonlinear motion. With these advantages in mind, I propose to research continuum robot arms made using foldable, laminate techniques, using an elephant trunk as a source of inspiration. The elephant trunk has more degrees of freedom than the standard robotic arm, which allows it to perform complex manipulation tasks in unstructured natural environments. This concept, when applied to a robotic arm, would allow it to be used in many more applications, and could be designed to accomplish a variety of tasks ill-suited to typical robot arms. Furthermore, the system could be designed to be collapsible, which would make it modular, portable, and easily deployable, increasing its applications further.</p><p><em>Funding for this project was provided by FURI and KEEN.</em></p><p>Students: Mannat Rana</p><p><span class=badge>archived</span></p><a href=/projects/archive/mannat-rana/><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Learn More...</button></a></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-heading><h3 class=panel-title>Low-Cost, Modular Force Control Solution</h3></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row equal"><div class=col-sm-3><a href=/projects/archive/jacob-knaup-force-sensing/><img class=img-responsive src=/assets/images/research/four-bar-force-sensor1.png alt></a></div><div class=col-sm-9><p>Force control offers numerous benefits to robots over other control schemes such as more natural movements and increased sensitivity to the surrounding environment, but it is typically only available to high-end robots.

The question focuses on which tail design is necessary to fix an inherently unstable object. This topic is derived from how a cheetah uses its tail to stabilize itself while catching prey. The question of developing  a design will be answered by creating a unity model inspired by a cheetah’s tail and simulate how it will stabilize an object that lacks balance. The selected platform is an rc car. The model is already developed in unity, but its movement is not unstable. After making the inherently unstable by adjusting the scaling of the object to make it taller, the motor speed, turning angle, mass of the cube, mass of the wheels, and radius of the wheels, a motor and tail will be added for balance. The selected rc car will be adjusted to match the parameters in unity. The expected result of this procedure is to have a display of a real life model matching the simulation.</p><p><em>This project was funded as part of a Barrett Honors thesis.</em></p><p>Students: Frank Ononye</p><p><span class=badge>quadruped</span></p><a href=/projects/archive/frank-onoye/><button type=button class="btn btn-primary">Learn More...</button></a></div></div></div></div><div class="panel panel-default"><div class=panel-heading><h3 class=panel-title>Signals in the Soil</h3></div><div class=panel-body><div class="row equal"><div class=col-sm-3><a href=/projects/archive/sits/><img class=img-responsive src=/assets/images/research/boring.png alt></a></div><div class=col-sm-9><p>What&rsquo;s inside the ground leaves us a mystery, and we are trying to use the self-boring robot nodes to collect signals underground.
