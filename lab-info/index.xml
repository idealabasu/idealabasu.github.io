Prototyping laminate robotic devices involves several planar processes which are available within the lab, including cutting, alignment, and lamination. We are capable of cutting a variety of flat, rolled, or sheet materials on either a Vinyl Express R31 Vinyl Cutter or an Epilog Fusion M2 CO2/Fiber Laser Cutter with a 28&amp;quot; x 40&amp;quot; bed.</description></item><item><title>Hiring</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/lab-info/hiring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/lab-info/hiring/</guid><description>We are currently not hiring at this time.</description></item><item><title>Lab Meeting Schedule</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/lab-info/meeting-schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/lab-info/meeting-schedule/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Professor Aukes' Calendar</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/lab-info/aukes_calendar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/lab-info/aukes_calendar/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Research Opportunities</title><link>https://idealab.asu.edu/lab-info/research-opportunities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://idealab.asu.edu/lab-info/research-opportunities/</guid><description>The IDEAlab at ASU is always looking for researchers in the field of robotics, design, and manufacturing.
